# Prompt Whisperer
Taming language models one prompt at a time.

Welcome to Prompt Whisperer â€” a living lab of Jupyter notebooks where I explore, experiment, and occasionally break things while working with large language models (LLMs). This repository serves as my personal playground for prompt engineering, LLM behaviors, RAGs, Agents and everything in between.
